      <h2><u>Why he's the GOAT </u> </h2>
      <p>
        Ronaldo is one of the best to ever play the game of football. Not only does he have deliver for his side time and time again, but he helps his teams reach the promisee land. Whether it's in England, Spain or Italy it doesn't matter, cause he always delivers. He shows up in big games just when it looks like his side have nothing left (ask Athletico Madrid), and he's not slowing down.

      <h2><u> The first player to score in ten consecutive international tournaments </u> </h2>
      <p>
        During the time period of 2004 to 2019, Ronaldo became the first player ever to score in 10 consecutive international tournaments. That feat included scoring at four World Cups, four Euros, a Confederations Cup, and the Nations League. Cristiano Ronaldo holds the record for scoring against the most national teams at 41 different nations.

      <h2> <u> First player to score a goal in every minute of the 90. </u> </h2>
      <p>
        The 36-year-old is the first player in footballing history to have scored in every single minute of the 90 across his playing career. The only other player to have matched him is Zlatan Ibrahimovic. Not surprisingly, the Portuguese captain reached this milestone back in 2014 where he scored against his favorite team to score against, Atletico Madrid.

      <h2><u>Champions League all-time top scorer</u></h2>
      <p>
        He is the tournament’s all-time top scorer, having scored an unprecedented 129 goals in 167 appearances. This is apart from 40 assists, which is also the most in the tournament’s history. But that alone still does not tell the whole story, as the Portuguese captain has many more records in the tournament. Ronaldo was the first-ever player to reach 100 carer wins in the UCL, and was also the first-ever player to score 100 UCL goals. He has won 5 Champions League medals, 1 at Manchester United, and 4 with Real Madrid, on all five occasions. He's also the all-time highest assister with generous 40 assists

      <h2><u> The best goals-per-game ratio in La Liga history</u></h2>
      <p id="goals-per-game">
        In 292 La Liga appearances, the ex-Real Madrid winger scored an astonishing 311 goals. This goal output led him to notch up a record 1.07 strike rate, dwarfing Messi’s 0.92. In essence, what we are saying is that Ronaldo has scored more goals than the games he's played, and that is an anomaly in world football today. His strike rate makes sense when you realize that he was the fastest player to reach 150 goals (148 matches), 200 goals (178 matches), and 300 goals (286 matches) in La Liga. Lest we forget, the 36-year-old also holds the record for the most hat-tricks in a La Liga campaign, with 8. From a goal-scoring point of view, the Spanish league will never see someone like the Madrid legend again. It's also incredible to think that Cristiano Ronaldo scored all of these goals playing as a left-winger!

      <h2> <u> Insane Stats </u></h2>
      <p>
        The 36-year-old Portuguese superstar has covered an average of 9.3 kilometres per game since his return to the English top flight. That is less than Kane, Mohamed Salah and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, but more than Lukaku's 8.6. However, when you look at the number of sprints per game, Ronaldo is actually surprisingly high. The Man Utd forward has averaged 15.1 sprints every 90 minutes in the Prem since the beginning of his second spell at Old Trafford. That is significantly more than both Kane and Lukaku, neither of whom exceed and average of 12.
